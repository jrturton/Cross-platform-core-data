Cross-platform-core-data
========================

A demo project showing how a Cocoa app can be used to create a base core data database for an iOS app. 

To experiment, build the Mac app, and open the .sqlite file that is contained within the project. Amend the data and save it, then build and run the iOS app.

The iOS app will clear out the documents directory and start fresh with a new copy of the default database on each launch.
